# FM-Synthesizer-Open-Source

## **Description**

Welcome to the repository of my final-year project: a Frequency Modulation (FM) Synthesizer with three operators. It is fully MIDI-compatible and exported as a VST plugin. 
The synthesizer includes a preset bank and visual displays for both waveform and spectrum analysis.
This synthesizer is completely free to use, and I encourage you to experiment with it! Feedback, suggestions, and any creations you make with it are more than welcome.

üéπ MIDI-Compatible: Integrates seamlessly with MIDI controllers.
üéõÔ∏è Three FM Operators: Flexible modulation for rich sound design.
üóÇÔ∏è Preset Bank: Save and load your favorite sounds.
üìä Visual Displays:
  -Spectrum Analyzer: Real-time frequency visualization.
  -Waveform Display: View the output waveform in real-time.
üîä Exported as a VST Plugin: Compatible with most DAWs.
